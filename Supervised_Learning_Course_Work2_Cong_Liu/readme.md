# About
This file is to provide the instructions for running tasks. Specificlly, it is for running `.py` files. All dataset must be located in the same folder with `.py` files.

# Part 1
In sum, there are two utility files in task 1, `Part1_utils_from_1_1_to_1_4.py` and `Part1_utils `. There are 6 tasks in part 1, corresponding to 6 running files naming like `Part1_*.py`. These main task files will refer functions in 2 utility files.
> Notice: Running these tasks in order to avoid data loading error. Because of the use of function `numpy.save()`, Task 1 must run first to save X and y data for the latter task. Similarly, Task 2 must run before Task 3 and 4.

# Part 2
In this part, all tasks are implemented independently naming like `Part2_task*.py`, which means there is no order required for running tasks.

# Part 3
This part contains one util file `Part3_utils.py`. And there is only one main running file `Part3.py`. Just running this file will get all implemented results in part 3.
