# UCL-Supervised-Learning-Courseworks
These are the courseworks for Module COMP0078 Supervised Learning. There are two courseworks in general. In the first coursework, linear regression, ridge regression, linear regression with kernel and K-nearest-neighbor is implemented on different datasets. 

The second coursework implements the perceptron algorithm using digital hand written data set, graph laplacian for two moon data set. Sample complexities of KNN, winnow, perceptron and linear regression are exmained by experiments.
